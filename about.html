            <h4>Withdrawal From Family</h4>

                    <p> When Nathaniel's father becomes consumed by his late-night
                        Chemistry work with Coppelius, he completely withdraws from his family, so much so that
                        Nathaniel
                        asks his mother, "Eh, mamma, who is this naughty Sandman, who always drives us away from papa?
                        What
                        does he look like? (Hoffman 87)" The father's participation in scientific experiments "drives"
                        him
                        away from his family, and instead of gathering with him, the children are sent away and learn to
                        associate their father's work with danger.

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>A year after Coppelius stopped coming to the house, Nathaniel recalls that his "father was very
                        cheerful." However, "when as the clock struck nine, we heard the house-door creak… ‘That is
                        Coppelius,’ said my mother, turning pale… The tears started from my mother’s eyes. ‘But
                        father—father!’ she cried, ‘must it be so?’ ‘He comes to me… go with the
                        children—go—go to bed.’ (Hoffman 93)” Although his wife was clearly unhappy, and his children
                        had to
                        leave and hide from his partner, Nathaniel's father chose to further his research. The father's
                        scientific pursuits showing how he prioritized Coppelius and scientific advancements over
                        comfort,
                        safety, and the overall relationship with his family.

            <h4>What She Represents</h4>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Olympia represents and idealized, yet unreal partner that sets standards so high that it simply
                        is
                        not achievable. Nathaniel wants to attain this perfection, when in reality he should be focusing
                        on
                        connection.

            <h4>Obsession with Olympia</h4>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Olympia is docile, agreeable, and beautiful, but she is a robot and has no true feelings for
                        herself.
                        Nathaniel becomes obsessed with her and neglects all other aspects of his life. "Clara's image
                        had
                        been wiped clean from his mind" (Hoffmann 112) and "his mother, Lothario, all had vanished from
                        memory" (Hoffmann 117).

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Nathaniel prefers the “predictability” and “passiveness” of Olympia over the real, flawed human
                        relationships (like with Clara). Nathaniel became so obsessed with Olympia that he neglected to
                        foster his true relationships, abandoning his letter to Clara and shutting off his family from
                        memory. Through this example, Hoffmann critiques the way technology can distance us from
                        authentic
                        social bonds.
